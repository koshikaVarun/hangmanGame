# Hangman Game

This Hangman Game project is a simple text-based implementation of the popular word-guessing game. It allows players to test their vocabulary and deduction skills by guessing letters to uncover a hidden word.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words.
- Displays the partially guessed word with underscores representing unguessed letters.
- Tracks the number of remaining tries and displays it to the player.
- Prevents duplicate letter guesses and provides appropriate feedback.
- Notifies the player of the game outcome (win or loss) at the end.
- User-friendly command-line interface.

## Getting Started

To run the Hangman Game locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java source files using the command: `javac HangmanGame.java`.

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly select a word from the word list.
2. The partially guessed word will be displayed with underscores representing unguessed letters.
3. You will be prompted to enter a letter guess.
4. Keep guessing letters to uncover the word. Each incorrect guess will decrement the number of remaining tries.
